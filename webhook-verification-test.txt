WEBHOOK VERIFICATION TEST ADDED
===============================

CHANGE MADE:
After channel creation, the system now automatically calls the webhook verification endpoint to test if it's working.

API CALL ADDED:
GET /webhook/{channelId}?hub.mode=subscribe&hub.verify_token={token}&hub.challenge=test_challenge_123

FLOW:
1. Channel created in database
2. Webhook URL constructed: {baseUrl}/webhook/{channelId}
3. Test verification call made automatically
4. If successful: logs "✅ Webhook verification test passed: test_challenge_123"
5. If failed: logs "⚠️ Webhook verification test failed: {status}"
6. Channel creation response returned

BENEFITS:
- Immediate feedback if webhook endpoint is working
- Validates webhook verification logic
- Helps debug webhook setup issues
- No impact on channel creation (test runs after channel is saved)

LOG EXAMPLES:
Success: "✅ Webhook verification test passed: test_challenge_123"
Failure: "⚠️ Webhook verification test failed: 404"
Error: "⚠️ Webhook verification test error: fetch failed"

This ensures the webhook endpoint is accessible and responding correctly before attempting Facebook/Instagram subscription.
